<p>Meme v2.0 - Udacity iOS nanodegree
by TechRapport -<a href="http://TechRapport.com">http://TechRapport.com</a></p>

<p>This app was created as a project for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree. Before taking the course, I took a month long course on UIKit Fundamentals through Udacity. This course firmed up my working knowledge of Apple's UIKit framework, which is used extensively for UI design, control and navigation. </p>

<p>The app offers the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a Meme by taking or selecting a photo</li>
<li>Add text to the top and bottom</li>
<li>Change the color, font and size of the text</li>
<li>Share and Save your Meme</li>
<li>View saved Memes in a UITableView and a UICollectionView</li>
<li>View a saved Meme</li>
<li>Edit a saved Meme</li>
</ul>

<p>See the extra credit features and what I intend to add next below. </p>

<h4>
<a id="technologies-and-best-practices-used" class="anchor" href="#technologies-and-best-practices-used" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technologies and best practices used</h4>

<p>Some of the more notable technologies and best practices I used in this app are shown below. I also wrote about some of these subjects in <a href="http://TechRapport.com/blog/">my blog</a> in the Swift development section.</p>

<ul>
<li>UIKit

<ul>
<li>UINavigationControllers</li>
<li>UITableViews</li>
<li>UICollectionViews</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MotionKit</li>
<li>Delegation</li>
<li>MVC</li>
<li>NSNotifications</li>
<li>Extensions</li>
</ul>

<p>As I stated above, I developed this application using several important design paradigms and best practices. Most notably, I used Model View Controller (MVC) extensively. I created a Model object for storing and processing Memes, several View Controllers for controlling navigation, writing to the model and updating the display. I also utilized extensions, <a href="http://techrapport.com/blog/">NSNotifications</a>, the delegate design pattern and more. I really enjoyed using Swift 2.0 and found that I was able to add a lot of functionality very easily using extensions. </p>

<h3>
<a id="git--github" class="anchor" href="#git--github" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git &amp; GitHub</h3>

<p>although, I have been using Git and other version control systems for many years, I have never used github professionally because my professional work has been private. I used best practices when using Git and github. I used separate branches for the two versions, wrote commit messages that were clear and concise, used Git to debug and I commit at logical points. </p>

<h3>
<a id="extra-credit" class="anchor" href="#extra-credit" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra Credit</h3>

<p>In order to receive extra credit and to receive Exceeds Specifications, I added additional functionality to v2.0 of Meme-Me. Some of the functionality that I added are shown below:</p>

<h4>
<a id="color-and-font-picker-which-both-show-as-uipopoverviews" class="anchor" href="#color-and-font-picker-which-both-show-as-uipopoverviews" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Color and font picker, which both show as UIPopoverViews.</h4>

<p>The color picker is really great and allows the user to select a color by gliding their finger over a group of colors, each of which shows up inside of a magnifying glass, showing the user which color they selected. As the color is picked, the font is updated in the view and the color/font attributes are stored with that instance of the Meme, so the user can edit the meme at a later time. </p>

<h4>
<a id="shake-to-reset" class="anchor" href="#shake-to-reset" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shake to reset</h4>

<p>I added a shake to reset feature, which greatly improved the experience by allowing the user to shake the phone to reset the font back to default. I did this using a single extension, which extends UIViewController. </p>

<h4>
<a id="extensions-for-delegates" class="anchor" href="#extensions-for-delegates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extensions for delegates</h4>

<p>As I was developing this app, I realized that my code was getting a bit complex, especially after I added delegate functions for the text fields, UITableViews, UICollectionViews, and other UIKit compononents. In order to make the code more readable and manageable, I once again used UIViewController extensions in order to add the delegate functions. I find that this is good practice as long as you contain the extensions in one file, preferably in the same file of the view controller that utilizes them. I would recommend utilizing extensions for basic delegate functionality that will be shared throughout your app. </p>

<h4>
<a id="more-features" class="anchor" href="#more-features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>More features</h4>

<p>Well, you'd think that I would be done with this app, but I am not. In the next iteration, I will be including Flickr images and randomly generated Memes. Keep a watch out for the next revision. </p>

<p>A special thanks goes to: "Christian Zimmermann" who wrote the code for the SwiftColorPicker. You can view his GitHub page here: <a href="https://github.com/Christian1313/iOS_Swift_ColorPicker">https://github.com/Christian1313/iOS_Swift_ColorPicker</a>.</p>
